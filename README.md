# Family Housing Predictor
## Background
Real estate is a billion-dollar industry but comes with many inefficiencies. Soon, realtors will be replaced by technology for their role as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. New innovations are changing how we approach real estate and it is for the better for ordinary people looking to buy or sell their first place.

This is used as a proof-of-concept idea where this model acts as a one-stop-shop for families to check the prices of the house that they chose, and then check their approval rate for the amount of mortgage they need.
